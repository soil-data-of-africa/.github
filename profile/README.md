# Soil Data of Africa

Soil Data of Africa is a platform facilitating cooperation around soil data and information in Africa.

This system is part of the knowledge and information platform of the AU-EU Partnership on Food Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture ([FNSSA](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-research-and-innovation/europe-world/international-cooperation/regional-dialogues-and-international-organisations/eu-africa-cooperation/partnership-food-and-nutrition-security-and-sustainable-agriculture-fnssa_en)).

The [Soils Information System for Africa](https://doi.org/10.3030/862900) research project initiated this initiative. The project ran between 2021 and 2025. The Soil Information System (SIS) enables farmers, 
agri-businesses, scientists, and policymakers in their efforts towards sustainable intensification of agriculture and boosting food security; by improving the quality and availability of African Soil Data.
